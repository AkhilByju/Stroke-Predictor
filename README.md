# Stroke-Predictor

This project predicts whether an individual is at risk of having a stroke using machine learning models trained on health and demographic data. It explores classical ML algorithms as well as a neural network built in PyTorch.

The project was created as part of a CS97 Machine Learning course project.

## üìà Results

* **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** achieved strong performance compared to other models.
* **Neural Network** implementation demonstrates the potential of deep learning but requires tuning for optimal performance.

**Evaluation includes:**

* Confusion Matrices
* ROC Curves with AUC Scores
* Comparative Accuracy
